# Bot that Extract Attachments from Email

This project is a Python bot that connects to an email account, searches for emails and extracts any attachments from those emails that are document files (PDF, XLS, XLSX, CSV, DOC). The bot creates a folder for each sender's email address and saves the documents to that folder.

You will need email credentials :

email server address
email account username
email account password
keywords to search for in email subject lines // not yet inserted
output directory for the saved documents
